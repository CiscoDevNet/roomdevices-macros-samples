# Cisco CE Room Devices - Macros
Here you can find a selection of macros for CE Room Devices. Macros is a great new feature intruduced in CE9.2 that allows you to customise your Room Device. It it especially powerful in combination with the In-Room Control Extensions of the Cisco Touch 10 Control Panel.

Macros available:


| Macro        | Description           |
| :------------------------ |:-------------|
| AppleTV Control      | Add an Apple TV remote control to the touch 10. All communication is done directly via HDMI-CEC. No control system needed.      |
| Audio Safe Guard      | Enforce a maximum output volume on the device. Demostrates a simple macro using API statuses and commands     |
| CodingExamples      | A collection of small snippets showing more common coding questions related to the macro language and XAPI usage.      |
| Camera Control with wide angle view      | Your custom camera control page, including creating a wide angle view of two cameras and controlling both simultaneously.      |
| Language Selector      | By default the touch 10 does not have a way for the end user to select the interface language. This macro adds this feature. Great for those multi-language environments. |
| Speed dials      | Always dialling the same few numbers from the meeting room. Maybe want to add calling 911 or the Pizza Place more prominent?     |
| One Button to Dial      | Do you always dial into the same bridge number? Why not have a single speed dial button on the home screen to do this?   |
| Customer Satisfaction | Want to add a survey at the end of a call? This macro does this for you |
| SX80 GPIO | See how to get the SX80 codec to perform some actions when triggering a change on the built in GPIO. Add an one-button-to-dial button on the wall. |
| Video Compositing | TC Console is no longer supported on CE firmware. But with Macros and In-Room controls and APIs you have more options and flexibility than ever. |
|  Custom Dial Pad  |  Add a custom 10-digit Dial Pad to your Touch 10


## Requirements
1. Cisco Room Device (MX, SX, DX and Room Kit series)
2. Firmware CE9.2.1 or newer.
3. Admin user access to endpoint

## Getting Started
1. Read the document [Working with Macros and In-room Controls](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/ce92/sx-mx-dx-room-kit-customization-guide-ce92.pdf) for a comprehensive introduction of In-Room Controls, Macros as well as step-by-step instructions on how to build and upload your code.
2. Watch this video for a quick introduction of what In-Room Controls are: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dw9zvvitp8


## Additional Information
##### XAPI
Documentation for the XAPI can be found in the [Command References overview](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/collaboration-endpoints/telepresence-quick-set-series/products-command-reference-list.html).

## Disclaimer
This example is only a sample and is **NOT guaranteed to be bug free and production quality**.

The sample macros are meant to:
- Illustrate how to use the CE Macros.
- Serve as an example of the step by step process of building a macro using JavaScript and integration with the Codec XAPI
- Provided as a guide for a developer to see how to initialize a macro and set up handlers for user and dialog updates.

The sample macros are made available to Cisco partners and customers as a convenience to help minimize the cost of Cisco Finesse customizations. Cisco does not permit the use of this library in customer deployments that do not include Cisco Video Endpoint Hardware.

## Support Notice
[Support](http://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/support) for the macros is provided on a "best effort" basis via DevNet. Like any custom deployment, it is the responsibility of the partner and/or customer to ensure that the customization works correctly and this includes ensuring that the macro is properly integrated into 3rd party applications.

It is Cisco's intention to ensure macro compatibility across versions as much as possible and Cisco will make every effort to clearly document any differences in the XAPI across versions in the event that a backwards compatibility impacting change is made.
